GTOR DAATA (Data Acquisition and Telemetry Application) Installer
*****************************************************************

This is the official installer for the GTOR DAATA application used to
collect and show data collected during various tests for Georgia Tech's
Off Road club.

As you click through the next few prompts a lot of files will be copied to
your machine. Let it keep running until otherwise prompted. 

One part of the process is that you will have to install the version of Python 
that we use for the application so that it works correctly. Follow its prompts 
and MAKE SURE THAT "Add to Path" IS CHECKED in the Python installer prompts.

The latest version of the installer can be downloaded from the GTOR website 
(https://www.gtoffroad.org/data-acquisition).

Please direct any problems or issues in using the installer to Benjamin Boeckman
on the Data Acquisition subteam.
